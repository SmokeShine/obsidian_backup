# Metaheuristics

- [[Improvement Heuristics]] may search only a limited space and can suffer from local minima/maxima
- Put the improvement heuristics in a box like metalearner in titan/learning to learn
	- the outside will call the improvement heuristic in different spaces
	- so the job of metaheuristic here is to select spaces and call improvement heuristic to search the neighbourhood
		- can use explore-exploit
			- where to explore and how much time to give for exploration
- does not care about the problem in hand
