# ARE GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS OPTIMAL APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS?

# Motivation
1. Can we get lower bound on approximation?
2. Can GNN work on new instances? Can it understand the distribution has shifted?
	1. Can it then solve it but also provide some guarantee on worst case solution quality
		1. How bad the approximation can be on new instances
		2. Can it be best possible approximation algorithm for a set of problems?
