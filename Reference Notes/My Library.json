  {"id":"abdullahPredictingOnlineLearners2025","abstract":"This systematic review sheds light on the role of ontologies in predicting achievement among online learners, in order to promote their academic success. In particular, it looks at the available literature on predicting online learners' performance through ontological machine-learning techniques and, using a systematic approach, identifies the existing methodologies and tools used to forecast students' performance. In addition, the environment for generating ontologies, as considered by academics in the field, is likewise identified. Based on the inclusion criteria and by adopting PRISMA as a research methodology, seven studies and two systematic reviews were selected. The findings reveal a scarcity of research devoted to ontologies in the prediction of learners' achievement. However, the research outcomes suggest that building an ontological model to harness machine-learning capabilities could help accurately predict students' academic performance. The results of this systematic review are useful for higher education institutes and curriculum planners. This is especially pertinent in online learning settings to avoid dropout or failure. Also highlighted in this study are numerous possible directions for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdullah","given":"Safa Ridha Albo"},{"family":"Al-Azawei","given":"Ahmed"}],"citation-key":"abdullahPredictingOnlineLearners2025","container-title":"International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"en","note":"ERIC Number: EJ1463389","page":"16-37","publisher":"Athabasca University Press","source":"ERIC","title":"Predicting Online Learners' Performance through Ontologies: A Systematic Literature Review","title-short":"Predicting Online Learners' Performance through Ontologies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1463389","volume":"26"},

In this talk, we will focus on the “algorithmic reasoning” task of learning a full algorithm. While GNNs have shown some promising empirical results, their generalization properties are less well understood. We will try to understand out-of-distribution generalization in widely used message passing GNNs, with an eye on applications in learning for optimization: what may be an appropriate metric for measuring shift? Under what conditions will a GNN generalize to larger graphs? In the last part of the talk, we will take a brief look at objective (loss) functions for learning with discrete objects, beyond GNNs. Neural networks work best with continuous, high-dimensional spaces. Can we integrate this into appropriate loss functions?\n\nTalk is based on joint work with Ching-Yao Chuang, Keyulu Xu, Joshua Robinson, Nikos Karalias, Jingling Li, Mozhi Zhang, Simon S.

  {"id":"amiriBiobjectiveGreenVehicle2023","abstract":"This paper considers a Green Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP), which includes heavy-duty electric and conventional trucks. We develop a new bi-objective programming model defined on a set of vertices, including a depot, a group of customers, and a set of charging stations. The first objective function is the minimization of the total cost of transportation. To meet the growing environmental concerns, we also consider a second objective function which minimizes total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. To solve the bi-objective problem, we integrate three multi-objective solution methods (i.e., weighted-sum,ε-constraint, and hybrid methods) with the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). We thereby generate a set of instances based on real-world locations in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and some parts of Ontario in Canada. These instances are then solved by applying the proposed solution methods. The obtained numerical results from the designed experiments revealed that by enhancing the charging power from 90 kW to 350 kW, transportation costs could decrease by up to 5 %. In addition, by doubling the number of stations in the same service area, delivery companies could lower their transportation costs by 2 %. Furthermore, a slight increase (less than 3 %) in transportation costs leads to a remarkable reduction (more than 18 %) in GHG emissions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Amiri","given":"Afsane"},{"family":"Amin","given":"Saman Hassanzadeh"},{"family":"Zolfagharinia","given":"Hossein"}],"citation-key":"amiriBiobjectiveGreenVehicle2023","container-title":"Expert Systems with Applications","container-title-short":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.eswa.2022.119228","ISSN":"0957-4174","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,1]]},"page":"119228","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A bi-objective green vehicle routing problem with a mixed fleet of conventional and electric trucks: Considering charging power and density of stations","title-short":"A bi-objective green vehicle routing problem with a mixed fleet of conventional and electric trucks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422022461","volume":"213"},

  {"id":"avciHybridMetaheuristicAlgorithm2016","abstract":"The Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (VRPSPD) is a variant of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) where the vehicles serve a set of customers demanding pickup and delivery services at the same time. The VRPSPD can arise in many transportation systems involving both distribution and collection operations. Originally, the VRPSPD assumes a homogeneous fleet of vehicles to serve the customers. However, in many practical situations, there are different types of vehicles available to perform the pickup and delivery operations. In this study, the original version of the VRPSPD is extended by assuming the fleet of vehicles to be heterogeneous. The Heterogeneous Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (HVRPSPD) is considered to be an NP-hard problem because it generalizes the classical VRP. For its solution, we develop a hybrid local search algorithm in which a non-monotone threshold adjusting strategy is integrated with tabu search. The threshold function used in the algorithm has an adaptive nature which makes it self-tuning. Additionally, its implementation is very simple as it requires no parameter tuning except for the tabu list length. The proposed algorithm is applied to a set of randomly generated problem instances. The results indicate that the developed approach can produce efficient and effective solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Avci","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Topaloglu","given":"Seyda"}],"citation-key":"avciHybridMetaheuristicAlgorithm2016","container-title":"Expert Systems with Applications","container-title-short":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.eswa.2016.01.038","ISSN":"0957-4174","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,1]]},"page":"160-171","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for heterogeneous vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417416000610","volume":"53"},

Existing multi-stage stochastic optimization approaches that allow to solve the underlying dynamic vehicle routing problem are either computationally too expensive for an application in online settings, or -- in the case of reinforcement learning -- struggle to perform well on high-dimensional combinatorial problems. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose a novel machine learning pipeline that incorporates a combinatorial optimization layer. We apply this general pipeline to a dynamic vehicle routing problem with dispatching waves, which was recently promoted in the EURO Meets NeurIPS Vehicle Routing Competition at NeurIPS 2022. Our methodology ranked first in this competition, outperforming all other approaches in solving the proposed dynamic vehicle routing problem. With this work, we provide a comprehensive numerical study that further highlights the efficacy and benefits of the proposed pipeline beyond the results achieved in the competition, e.g., by showcasing the robustness of the encoded policy against unseen instances and scenarios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Baty","given":"Léo"},{"family":"Jungel","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Patrick S."},{"family":"Parmentier","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Schiffer","given":"Maximilian"}],"citation-key":"batyCombinatorialOptimizationEnriched2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"number":"arXiv:2304.00789","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Combinatorial Optimization enriched Machine Learning to solve the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00789"},

The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information (“LLM thoughts”) are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes.

Especially since the rise of graph neural networks (GNNs), the deep learning community has been developing solvers that derive solutions to NP-hard problems by learning the problem-specific solution structure. However, reproducing the results of these publications proves to be difficult. We make three contributions. First, we present an open-source benchmark suite for the NP-hard MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET problem, in both its weighted and unweighted variants. The suite offers a unified interface to various state-of-the-art traditional and machine learning-based solvers. Second, using our benchmark suite, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the popular guided tree search algorithm by Li et al. [NeurIPS 2018], testing various configurations on small and large synthetic and real-world graphs. By re-implementing their algorithm with a focus on code quality and extensibility, we show that the graph convolution network used in the tree search does not learn a meaningful representation of the solution structure, and can in fact be replaced by random values. Instead, the tree search relies on algorithmic techniques like graph kernelization to find good solutions. Thus, the results from the original publication are not reproducible. Third, we extend the analysis to compare the tree search implementations to other solvers, showing that the classical algorithmic solvers often are faster, while providing solutions of similar quality. Additionally, we analyze a recent solver based on reinforcement learning and observe that for this solver, the GNN is responsible for the competitive solution quality.","author":[{"family":"Bother","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Kißig","given":"Otto"},{"family":"Taraz","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Sarel"},{"family":"Seidel","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Friedrich","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"botherWHATWRONGDEEP2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"WHAT’S WRONG WITH DEEP LEARNING IN TREE SEARCH FOR COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION","type":"article-journal"},

This paper asserts that LLMs possess the capability for zero-shot optimization across diverse scenarios, including multi-objective and high-dimensional problems. We introduce a novel population-based method for numerical optimization using LLMs called Language-Model-Based Evolutionary Optimizer (LEO). Our hypothesis is supported through numerical examples, spanning benchmark and industrial engineering problems such as supersonic nozzle shape optimization, heat transfer, and windfarm layout optimization. We compare our method to several gradient-based and gradient-free optimization approaches. While LLMs yield comparable results to state-of-the-art methods, their imaginative nature and propensity to hallucinate demand careful handling. We provide practical guidelines for obtaining reliable answers from LLMs and discuss method limitations and potential research directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Brahmachary","given":"Shuvayan"},{"family":"Joshi","given":"Subodh M."},{"family":"Panda","given":"Aniruddha"},{"family":"Koneripalli","given":"Kaushik"},{"family":"Sagotra","given":"Arun Kumar"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Harshil"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Ankush"},{"family":"Jagtap","given":"Ameya D."},{"family":"Kalyanaraman","given":"Kaushic"}],"citation-key":"brahmacharyLargeLanguageModelBased2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2403.02054","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,4]]},"number":"arXiv:2403.02054","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Large Language Model-Based Evolutionary Optimizer: Reasoning with elitism","title-short":"Large Language Model-Based Evolutionary Optimizer","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02054"},
  {"id":"bressonTransformerNetworkTraveling2021","abstract":"The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the most popular and most studied combinatorial problem, starting with von Neumann in 1951. It has driven the discovery of several optimization techniques such as cutting planes, branch-and-bound, local search, Lagrangian relaxation, and simulated annealing. The last five years have seen the emergence of promising techniques where (graph) neural networks have been capable to learn new combinatorial algorithms. The main question is whether deep learning can learn better heuristics from data, i.e. replacing human-engineered heuristics? This is appealing because developing algorithms to tackle efficiently NP-hard problems may require years of research, and many industry problems are combinatorial by nature. In this work, we propose to adapt the recent successful Transformer architecture originally developed for natural language processing to the combinatorial TSP. Training is done by reinforcement learning, hence without TSP training solutions, and decoding uses beam search. We report improved performances over recent learned heuristics with an optimal gap of 0.004% for TSP50 and 0.39% for TSP100.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bresson","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Laurent","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"bressonTransformerNetworkTraveling2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,4]]},"number":"arXiv:2103.03012","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Transformer Network for the Traveling Salesman Problem","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03012"},

  {"id":"chalumeauSeaPearlConstraintProgramming2021","abstract":"The design of efficient and generic algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems has been an active field of research for many years. Standard exact solving approaches are based on a clever and complete enumeration of the solution set. A critical and non-trivial design choice with such methods is the branching strategy, directing how the search is performed. The last decade has shown an increasing interest in the design of machine learning-based heuristics to solve combinatorial optimization problems. The goal is to leverage knowledge from historical data to solve similar new instances of a problem. Used alone, such heuristics are only able to provide approximate solutions efficiently, but cannot prove optimality nor bounds on their solution. Recent works have shown that reinforcement learning can be successfully used for driving the search phase of constraint programming (CP) solvers. However, it has also been shown that this hybridization is challenging to build, as standard CP frameworks do not natively include machine learning mechanisms, leading to some sources of inefficiencies. This paper presents the proof of concept for SeaPearl, a new CP solver implemented in Julia, that supports machine learning routines in order to learn branching decisions using reinforcement learning. Support for modeling the learning component is also provided. We illustrate the modeling and solution performance of this new solver on two problems. Although not yet competitive with industrial solvers, SeaPearl aims to provide a flexible and open-source framework in order to facilitate future research in the hybridization of constraint programming and machine learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Chalumeau","given":"Félix"},{"family":"Coulon","given":"Ilan"},{"family":"Cappart","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Rousseau","given":"Louis-Martin"}],"citation-key":"chalumeauSeaPearlConstraintProgramming2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2102.09193","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,18]]},"number":"arXiv:2102.09193","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"SeaPearl: A Constraint Programming Solver guided by Reinforcement Learning","title-short":"SeaPearl","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09193","version":"1"},

What we are proposing here is a general relaxation procedure whereby the state-space associated with a given dynamic programming recursion is relaxed in such a way that the solution to the relaxed recursion provides a bound which could be embedded in general branch and bound schemes for the solution of the problem. This state space relaxation method is analogous to Langrangian relaxation in integer programming.

  {"id":"ColumnGeneration2022","abstract":"Column generation or delayed column generation is an efficient algorithm for solving large linear programs.\nThe overarching idea is that many linear programs are too large to consider all the variables explicitly. The idea is thus to start by solving the considered program with only a subset of its variables.  Then iteratively, variables that have the potential to improve the objective function are added to the program. Once it is possible to demonstrate that adding new variables would no longer improve the value of the objective function, the procedure stops. The hope when applying a column generation algorithm is that only a very small fraction of the variables will be generated. This hope is supported by the fact that in the optimal solution, most variables will be non-basic and assume a value of zero, so the optimal solution can be found without them.\nIn many cases, this method allows to solve large linear programs that would otherwise be intractable. The classical example of a problem where it is successfully used is the cutting stock problem. One particular technique in linear programming which uses this kind of approach is the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition algorithm.  Additionally, column generation has been applied to many problems such as crew scheduling, vehicle routing, and the capacitated p-median problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,9]]},"citation-key":"ColumnGeneration2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,5]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1070050050","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Column generation","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Column_generation&oldid=1070050050"},

  {"id":"croitoruDiffusionModelsVision2022","abstract":"Denoising diffusion models represent a recent emerging topic in computer vision, demonstrating remarkable results in the area of generative modeling. A diffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a forward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion stage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the original input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process, step by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and diversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens, i.e. low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising diffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical contributions in the field. First, we identify and present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion models and other deep generative models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, energy-based models, autoregressive models and normalizing flows.

The master problem is a set-partitioning problem, and the pricing problem is a speed- and start-time elementary shortest path problem with resource constraints, in which the speed and start time at the depot needs to be decided on for each individual route. The master problem is solved by means of column generation, and a tailored labeling algorithm is used to solve the pricing problem.

This paper presents an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm (ALNS), combined with a speed optimization procedure, to solve the bi-objective PRP. Using the ALNS as the search engine, four a posteriori methods, namely the weighting method, the weighting method with normalization, the epsilon-constraint method and a new hybrid method (HM), are tested using a scalarization of the two objective functions.

  {"id":"desaulniersExactAlgorithmsElectric2016","abstract":"Effective route planning for battery electric commercial vehicle (ECV) fleets has to take into account their limited autonomy and the possibility of visiting recharging stations during the course of a route. In this paper, we consider four variants of the electric vehicle-routing problem with time windows: (i) at most a single recharge per route is allowed, and batteries are fully recharged on visit of a recharging station; (ii) multiple recharges per route, full recharges only; (iii) at most a single recharge per route, and partial battery recharges are possible; and (iv) multiple, partial recharges. For each variant, we present exact branch-price-and-cut algorithms that rely on customized monodirectional and bidirectional labeling algorithms for generating feasible vehicle routes. In computational studies, we find that all four variants are solvable for instances with up to 100 customers and 21 recharging stations. This success can be attributed to the tailored resource extension functions (REFs) that enable efficient labeling with constant time feasibility checking and strong dominance rules, even if these REFs are intricate and rather elaborate to derive. The studies also highlight the superiority of the bidirectional labeling algorithms compared to the monodirectional ones.

  {"id":"deudonLearningHeuristicsTSP2018","abstract":"The aim of the study is to provide interesting insights on how eﬃcient machine learning algorithms could be adapted to solve combinatorial optimization problems in conjunction with existing heuristic procedures. More speciﬁcally, we extend the neural combinatorial optimization framework to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP). In this framework, the city coordinates are used as inputs and the neural network is trained using reinforcement learning to predict a distribution over city permutations. Our proposed framework diﬀers from the one in [1] since we do not make use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture and we opted to design our own critic to compute a baseline for the tour length which results in more eﬃcient learning. More importantly, we further enhance the solution approach with the well-known 2-opt heuristic. The results show that the performance of the proposed framework alone is generally as good as high performance heuristics (ORTools). When the framework is equipped with a simple 2-opt procedure, it could outperform such heuristics and achieve close to optimal results on 2D Euclidean graphs. This demonstrates that our approach based on machine learning techniques could learn good heuristics which, once being enhanced with a simple local search, yield promising results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Deudon","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Cournut","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Lacoste","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Adulyasak","given":"Yossiri"},{"family":"Rousseau","given":"Louis-Martin"}],"citation-key":"deudonLearningHeuristicsTSP2018","container-title":"Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-93031-2_12","editor":[{"family":"Van Hoeve","given":"Willem-Jan"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-319-93030-5 978-3-319-93031-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"170-181","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Learning Heuristics for the TSP by Policy Gradient","type":"chapter","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-93031-2_12","volume":"10848"},

  {"id":"drakulicBQNCOBisimulationQuotienting2023","abstract":"Despite the success of neural-based combinatorial optimization methods for end-toend heuristic learning, out-of-distribution generalization remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs) as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that effectively leverages common symmetries of COPs to improve out-of-distribution robustness. Starting from a direct MDP formulation of a constructive method, we introduce a generic way to reduce the state space, based on Bisimulation Quotienting (BQ) in MDPs. Then, for COPs with a recursive nature, we specialize the bisimulation and show how the reduced state exploits the symmetries of these problems and facilitates MDP solving. Our approach is principled and we prove that an optimal policy for the proposed BQ-MDP actually solves the associated COPs. We illustrate our approach on five classical problems: the Euclidean and Asymmetric Traveling Salesman, Capacitated Vehicle Routing, Orienteering and Knapsack Problems. Furthermore, for each problem, we introduce a simple attention-based policy network for the BQMDPs, which we train by imitation of (near) optimal solutions of small instances from a single distribution. We obtain new state-of-the-art results for the five COPs on both synthetic and realistic benchmarks. Notably, in contrast to most existing neural approaches, our learned policies show excellent generalization performance to much larger instances than seen during training, without any additional search procedure.

This emerging ﬁeld has witnessed an extensive growth of promising techniques that have been applied with success to computer science, mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry. But for any successful ﬁeld to become mainstream and reliable, benchmarks must be developed to quantify progress. This led us in March 2020 to release a benchmark framework that i) comprises of a diverse collection of mathematical and real-world graphs, ii) enables fair model comparison with the same parameter budget to identify key architectures, iii) has an open-source, easy-to-use and reproducible code infrastructure, and iv) is ﬂexible for researchers to experiment with new theoretical ideas. As of December 2022, the GitHub repository1 has reached 2,000 stars and 380 forks, which demonstrates the utility of the proposed open-source framework through the wide usage by the GNN community. In this paper, we present an updated version of our benchmark with a concise presentation of the aforementioned framework characteristics, an additional medium-sized molecular dataset AQSOL, similar to the popular ZINC, but with a real-world measured chemical target, and discuss how this framework can be leveraged to explore new GNN designs and insights. As a proof of value of our benchmark, we study the case of graph positional encoding (PE) in GNNs, which was introduced with this benchmark and has since spurred interest of exploring more powerful PE for Transformers and GNNs in a robust experimental setting.","author":[{"family":"Dwivedi","given":"Vijay Prakash"},{"family":"Joshi","given":"Chaitanya K"},{"family":"Luu","given":"Anh Tuan"},{"family":"Laurent","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Bengio","given":"Yoshua"},{"family":"Bresson","given":"Xavier"}],"citation-key":"dwivediBenchmarkingGraphNeural","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks","type":"article-journal"},

Nowadays, due to the new policies and regulations related to greenhouse gas emission in the transport sector, logistic companies are paying higher penalties for each emission gram of /km. With electric vehicle market penetration, many companies are evaluating the integration of electric vehicles in their fleet, as they do not have local greenhouse gas emissions, produce minimal noise, and are independent of the fluctuating oil price. The well-researched vehicle routing problem (VRP) is extended to the electric vehicle routing problem (E-VRP), which takes into account specific characteristics of electric vehicles. In this paper, a literature review on recent developments regarding the E-VRP is presented. The challenges that emerged with the integration of electric vehicles in the delivery processes are described, together with electric vehicle characteristics and recent energy consumption models. Several variants of the E-VRP and related problems are observed. To cope with the new routing challenges in E-VRP, efficient VRP heuristics and metaheuristics had to be adapted. An overview of the state-of-the-art procedures for solving the E-VRP and related problems is presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Erdelić","given":"Tomislav"},{"family":"Carić","given":"Tonči"}],"citation-key":"erdelicSurveyElectricVehicle2019","container-title":"Journal of Advanced Transportation","DOI":"10.1155/2019/5075671","ISSN":"0197-6729","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,9]]},"language":"en","page":"e5075671","publisher":"Hindawi","source":"www.hindawi.com","title":"A Survey on the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem: Variants and Solution Approaches","title-short":"A Survey on the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jat/2019/5075671/","volume":"2019"},

While deriving the first-order gradient estimators by differentiating a surrogate loss (SL) objective is computationally and conceptually simple, using the same approach for higher-order derivatives is more challenging. Firstly, analytically deriving and implementing such estimators is laborious and not compliant with automatic differentiation. Secondly, repeatedly applying SL to construct new objectives for each order derivative involves increasingly cumbersome graph manipulations. Lastly, to match the first-order gradient under differentiation, SL treats part of the cost as a fixed sample, which we show leads to missing and wrong terms for estimators of higher-order derivatives. To address all these shortcomings in a unified way, we introduce DiCE, which provides a single objective that can be differentiated repeatedly, generating correct estimators of derivatives of any order in SCGs. Unlike SL, DiCE relies on automatic differentiation for performing the requisite graph manipulations. We verify the correctness of DiCE both through a proof and numerical evaluation of the DiCE derivative estimates. We also use DiCE to propose and evaluate a novel approach for multi-agent learning.

Contrary to existing routing models for ECVs, which assume energy consumption to be a linear function of traveled distance, we utilize a realistic energy consumption model that incorporates speed, gradient and cargo load distribution. This is highly relevant in the context of ECVs because energy consumption determines the maximal driving range of ECVs and the recharging times at stations. To address the problem, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm that is enhanced by a local search for intensification. In numerical studies on newly designed E-VRPTWMF test instances, we investigate the effect of considering the actual load distribution on the structure and quality of the generated solutions.

In their efforts to increase road safety and improve working conditions of truck drivers, governments worldwide are enforcing stricter limits on the amount of working and driving time without rest. This paper describes an effective optimization algorithm for minimizing transportation costs for a fleet of vehicles considering business hours of customers and hours of service regulations. The algorithm combines the exploration capacities of population-based metaheuristics, the quick improvement abilities of local search, with forward labeling procedures for checking compliance with complex hours of service regulations. Several speedup techniques are proposed to achieve an overall efficient approach. The proposed approach is used to assess the impact of different hours of service regulations from a carrier-centric point of view. Extensive computational experiments for various sets of regulations in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Australia are conducted to provide an international assessment of the impact of different rules on transportation costs and accident risks. Our experiments demonstrate that European Union rules lead to the highest safety, whereas Canadian regulations are the most competitive in terms of economic efficiency. Australian regulations appear to have unnecessarily high risk rates with respect to operating costs. The recent rule change in the United States reduces accident risk rates with a moderate increase in operating costs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Goel","given":"Asvin"},{"family":"Vidal","given":"Thibaut"}],"citation-key":"goelHoursServiceRegulations2014","container-title":"Transportation Science","ISSN":"0041-1655","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"391-412","publisher":"INFORMS","source":"JSTOR","title":"Hours of Service Regulations in Road Freight Transport: An Optimization-Based International Assessment","title-short":"Hours of Service Regulations in Road Freight Transport","type":"article-journal","volume":"48"},

Training such models requires a lot of computational resources (e.g., HPC clusters) that are not available to small research groups and independent researchers. One way to address it is for several smaller groups to pool their computational resources together and train a model that benefits all participants. Unfortunately, in this case, any participant can jeopardize the entire training run by sending incorrect updates, deliberately or by mistake. Training in presence of such peers requires specialized distributed training algorithms with Byzantine tolerance. These algorithms often sacrifice efficiency by introducing redundant communication or passing all updates through a trusted server, making it infeasible to apply them to large-scale deep learning, where models can have billions of parameters.

The great variety in the literature stems from the many possible strategies for coarsening a graph, which may depend on different assumptions on the graph structure or the specific downstream task. In this paper we propose a formal characterization of graph pooling based on three main operations, called selection, reduction, and connection, with the goal of unifying the literature under a common framework. Following this formalization, we introduce a taxonomy of pooling operators and categorize more than thirty pooling methods proposed in recent literature. We propose criteria to evaluate the performance of a pooling operator and use them to investigate and contrast the behavior of different classes of the taxonomy on a variety of tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Grattarola","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Zambon","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Bianchi","given":"Filippo Maria"},{"family":"Alippi","given":"Cesare"}],"citation-key":"grattarolaUnderstandingPoolingGraph2022","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

Based on industry data and using a sustainable supply chain optimization framework covering economic, environmental and social objectives, the study analyzes where jobs could be created or cut down, how total emissions in the supply chain including the usage phase of passenger cars could be reduced and how supply chain wide costs would develop.

  {"id":"guoDeepAttentionModels2023","abstract":"Time dependencies of travel speeds in time-dependent vehicle routing problems (TDVRPs) are usually accounted for by discretizing the planning horizon into several time periods. However, travel speeds usually change frequently in real road networks, so many time periods are needed to evaluate candidate solutions accurately in model and solution construction for practical TDVRPs, which increases substantially the computational complexity of TDVRPs. We develop two deep attention models with dimension-reduction and gate mechanisms to solve practical TDVRPs in real urban road networks. In the two models, a multi-head attention-based dimension-reduction mechanism is proposed to reduce the dimension of model inputs and obtain enhanced node representation, whereas a gate mechanism is introduced to obtain better information representation. On the basis of a travel speed dataset from an urban road network, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models on practical TDVRPs with or without consideration of time windows. Experimental results show that our models can solve TDVRPs with 240 time periods and up to 250 customers effectively and efficiently and provide significantly superior overall performances over two representative heuristics and two state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning models. Especially, compared with a recent tabu search method, our models can reduce the computation time by up to 3,540 times and improve the solution performance by up to 23%. Moreover, our models have an outstanding generalization performance. The model trained for the 30-customer TDVRP with time windows can be used directly to solve problems with up to 250 customers effectively by generating superior solutions over those generated by benchmarking methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Qu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Miao"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Zhaoxia"},{"family":"Wallace","given":"Stein W."}],"citation-key":"guoDeepAttentionModels2023","container-title":"Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","container-title-short":"Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.tre.2023.103095","ISSN":"1366-5545","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"page":"103095","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Deep attention models with dimension-reduction and gate mechanisms for solving practical time-dependent vehicle routing problems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1366554523000832","volume":"173"},

The vehicle routing problem with simultaneous delivery and pickup (VRPSDP) has become one of the most important areas of logistics management. Most related studies are aimed at minimizing travel time. However, the total number of collected goods is also very important to logistics companies. Thus, only considering the traveling time cannot reflect actual practice. To effectively optimize these operations for logistics companies, this paper introduces the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery considering the total number of collected goods. Based on the principles of considering the number of collected goods, a bi-objective vehicle routing model minimizing the total travel time and maximizing the total number of collected goods simultaneously is developed. A polynomial time approximation algorithm based on the ε-constraint method is designed to address this problem, and the approximation ratio of the algorithm is analyzed. Finally, the validity and feasibility of the proposed model and algorithm are verified by test examples, and several managerial insights are derived from the sensitivity analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Qinge"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Nengmin"}],"citation-key":"guoVehicleRoutingProblem2023","container-title":"Mathematics","DOI":"10.3390/math11020311","ISSN":"2227-7390","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"311","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery Considering the Total Number of Collected Goods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/11/2/311","volume":"11"},

However, solving large TSP instances quickly without sacrificing solution quality remains challenging for current approximate algorithms. To close this gap, we present a hybrid data-driven approach for solving the TSP based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Guided Local Search (GLS). Our model predicts the regret of including each edge of the problem graph in the solution; GLS uses these predictions in conjunction with the original problem graph to find solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach converges to optimal solutions at a faster rate than three recent learning based approaches for the TSP. Notably, we reduce the mean optimality gap on the 100-node problem set from 1.534% to 0.705%, a 2x improvement.

  {"id":"HybridDeepReinforcement","abstract":"Different variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) have been studied for decades. State-of-the-art methods based on local search have been developed for VRPs, while still facing problems of slow running time and poor solution quality in the case of large problem size. To overcome these problems, we first propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, which is composed of an actor, an adaptive critic and a routing simulator. The actor, based on the attention mechanism, is designed to generate routing strategies. The adaptive critic is devised to change the network structure adaptively, in order to accelerate the convergence rate and improve the solution quality during training. The routing simulator is developed to provide graph information and reward with the actor and adaptive cirtic. Then, we combine this DRL model with a local search method to further improve the solution quality. The output of the DRL model can serve as the initial solution for the following local search method, from where the final solution of the VRP is obtained. Tested on three datasets with customer points of 20, 50 and 100 respectively, experimental results demonstrate that the DRL model alone finds better solutions compared to construction algorithms and previous DRL approaches, while enabling a 5- to 40-fold speedup. We also observe that combining the DRL model with various local search methods yields excellent solutions at a superior generation speed, comparing to that of other initial solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"citation-key":"HybridDeepReinforcement","language":"en-US","title":"A Hybrid of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Local Search for the Vehicle Routing Problems","type":"webpage","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9141401"},

Analogous to the diffusion process, where Gaussian noise is used to create random trajectories that walk away from the data manifold, we construct trajectories that move away from potential goal states. We then learn a goal-conditioned policy to reverse these deviations, analogous to the score function. This approach, which we call Merlin, can reach specified goals from arbitrary initial states without learning a separate value function. In contrast to recent works utilizing diffusion models in offline RL, Merlin stands out as the first method to perform diffusion in the state space, requiring only one ``denoising\" iteration per environment step. We experimentally validate our approach in various offline goal-reaching tasks, demonstrating substantial performance enhancements compared to state-of-the-art methods while improving computational efficiency over other diffusion-based RL methods by an order of magnitude.

However, the incorporation of EVs in L&T activities also raise some additional challenges from the strategic, planning, and operational perspectives. For instance, smart cities are required to provide recharge stations for electric-based vehicles, meaning that investment decisions need to be made about the number, location, and capacity of these stations. Similarly, the limited driving-range capabilities of EVs, which are restricted by the amount of electricity stored in their batteries, impose non-trivial additional constraints when designing efficient distribution routes. Accordingly, this paper identifies and reviews several open research challenges related to the introduction of EVs in L&T activities, including: (a) environmental-related issues; and (b) strategic, planning and operational issues associated with “standard” EVs and with hydrogen-based EVs. The paper also analyzes how the introduction of EVs in L&T systems generates new variants of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem, one of the most studied optimization problems in the L&T field, and proposes the use of metaheuristics and simheuristics as the most efficient way to deal with these complex optimization problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Juan","given":"Angel Alejandro"},{"family":"Mendez","given":"Carlos Alberto"},{"family":"Faulin","given":"Javier"},{"family":"De Armas","given":"Jesica"},{"family":"Grasman","given":"Scott Erwin"}],"citation-key":"juanElectricVehiclesLogistics2016","container-title":"Energies","ISSN":"1996-1073","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","page":"86","title":"Electric Vehicles in Logistics and Transportation: A Survey on Emerging Environmental, Strategic, and Operational Challenges","title-short":"Electric Vehicles in Logistics and Transportation","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"keskinMatheuristicMethodElectric2018","abstract":"The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (EVRPTW) is an extension of the well-known VRPTW where electric vehicles (EVs) are used instead of internal combustion engine vehicles. An EV has a limited driving range due to its battery capacity and may need recharging to complete its route. Recharging can be made at any battery level and may be at any quantity up to the battery capacity. Furthermore, the stations may be equipped with chargers with different power supply, power voltage, maximum current options which affect the recharge duration. In this study, we model the EVRPTW by allowing partial recharges with three recharging configurations which can be referred to as normal, fast and super-fast recharges. In faster options, the battery is charged with the same energy in a shorter time but at a higher cost. Our objective is to minimize the total recharging cost while operating minimum number of vehicles. We formulated this problem as a mixed integer linear program and solved the small instances using CPLEX. To solve the larger problems, we develop a matheuristic approach which couples the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) approach with an exact method. Our ALNS is equipped with various destroy-repair algorithms to efficiently explore the neighborhoods and uses CPLEX to strengthen the routes obtained. We carried out extensive experiments to investigate the benefits of fast recharges and test the performance of our algorithm using benchmark instances from the literature. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed matheuristic and demonstrate the benefits of fast chargers on the fleet size and energy costs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Keskin","given":"Merve"},{"family":"Çatay","given":"Bülent"}],"citation-key":"keskinMatheuristicMethodElectric2018","container-title":"Computers & Operations Research","container-title-short":"Computers & Operations Research","ISSN":"0305-0548","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,1]]},"page":"172-188","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A matheuristic method for the electric vehicle routing problem with time windows and fast chargers","type":"article-journal","volume":"100"},
  {"id":"kingRecyclingHeuristicCapable2024","abstract":"Instances of the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and its variants are notoriously difficult to solve. Moreover, when combining characteristics of multiple VRP variants, the underlying complexities of the variants proliferate. This has led to a variety of metaheuristics being proposed for solving VRP instances with side constraints. Metaheuristics, however, require the generation of an appropriate initial solution (trajectory-based metaheuristics) or a population of initial solutions (population-based metaheuristics), the quality of which affects the performance of the solution approach. When computing VRP solutions for a depot and its assigned customers, historical solutions generated for the same depot may be adapted to form the initial solution or part of the initial population for the metaheuristic employed, thereby effectively recycling historical solutions. In this paper, such a recycling heuristic is proposed. A genetic algorithm is applied to solve instances of the periodic VRP with time-windows (PVRPTW) and the effect of the recycling heuristic on the run time of the metaheuristic is evaluated. It is shown that a decrease in run time of up to 26% may be achieved by employing the recycling heuristic to generate initial solutions, without affecting the quality of the solutions returned.","author":[{"family":"King","given":"Jacobus"},{"family":"Vuuren","given":"Jan","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"kingRecyclingHeuristicCapable2024","container-title":"Optimization in Green Sustainability and Ecological Transition","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-47686-0_11","editor":[{"family":"Bruglieri","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Festa","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Macrina","given":"Giusy"},{"family":"Pisacane","given":"Ornella"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-47686-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","page":"119-129","publisher":"Springer Nature Switzerland","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"A Recycling Heuristic Capable of Generating Initial Solutions for Use in Vehicle Routing Metaheuristics","type":"paper-conference"},

A popular approach is to use a neural net to compute on the parameters of a given CO problem and extract useful information that guides the search for good solutions. Many CO problems of practical importance can be specified in a matrix form of parameters quantifying the relationship between two groups of items. There is currently no neural net model, however, that takes in such matrix-style relationship data as an input. Consequently, these types of CO problems have been out of reach for ML engineers. In this paper, we introduce Matrix Encoding Network (MatNet) and show how conveniently it takes in and processes parameters of such complex CO problems. Using an end-to-end model based on MatNet, we solve asymmetric traveling salesman (ATSP) and flexible flow shop (FFSP) problems as the earliest neural approach.

  {"id":"leiSolveRoutingProblems2021","abstract":"For NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, it is usually difficult to find high-quality solutions in polynomial time. The design of either an exact algorithm or an approximate algorithm for these problems often requires significantly specialized knowledge. Recently, deep learning methods provide new directions to solve such problems. In this paper, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework is proposed to solve this type of combinatorial optimization problems. This framework can be applied to different problems with only slight changes of input (for example, for a traveling salesman problem (TSP), the input is the two-dimensional coordinates of nodes; while for a capacity-constrained vehicle routing problem (CVRP), the input is simply changed to three-dimensional vectors including the two-dimensional coordinates and the customer demands of nodes), masks and decoder context vectors. The proposed framework is aiming to improve the models in literacy in terms of the neural network model and the training algorithm. The solution quality of TSP and the CVRP up to 100 nodes are significantly improved via our framework. Specifically, the average optimality gap is reduced from 4.53\\% (reported best \\cite{R22}) to 3.67\\% for TSP with 100 nodes and from 7.34\\% (reported best \\cite{R22}) to 6.68\\% for CVRP with 100 nodes when using the greedy decoding strategy. Furthermore, our framework uses about 1/3$\\sim$3/4 training samples compared with other existing learning methods while achieving better results. The results performed on randomly generated instances and the benchmark instances from TSPLIB and CVRPLIB confirm that our framework has a linear running time on the problem size (number of nodes) during the testing phase, and has a good generalization performance from random instance training to real-world instance testing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Lei","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wenchao"}],"citation-key":"leiSolveRoutingProblems2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2105.02730","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,6]]},"number":"arXiv:2105.02730","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Solve routing problems with a residual edge-graph attention neural network","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02730"},

  {"id":"liDeepReinforcementLearning2022","abstract":"Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods for solving the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) intrinsically cope with homogeneous vehicle fleet, in which the fleet is assumed as repetitions of a single vehicle. Hence, their key to construct a solution solely lies in the selection of the next node (customer) to visit excluding the selection of vehicle. However, vehicles in real-world scenarios are likely to be heterogeneous with different characteristics that affect their capacity (or travel speed), rendering existing DRL methods less effective. In this paper, we tackle heterogeneous CVRP (HCVRP), where vehicles are mainly characterized by different capacities. We consider both min-max and min-sum objectives for HCVRP, which aim to minimize the longest or total travel time of the vehicle(s) in the fleet. To solve those problems, we propose a DRL method based on the attention mechanism with a vehicle selection decoder accounting for the heterogeneous fleet constraint and a node selection decoder accounting for the route construction, which learns to construct a solution by automatically selecting both a vehicle and a node for this vehicle at each step. Experimental results based on randomly generated instances show that, with desirable generalization to various problem sizes, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art DRL method and most of the conventional heuristics, and also delivers competitive performance against the state-of-the-art heuristic method, i.e., SISR. Additionally, the results of extended experiments demonstrate that our method is also able to solve CVRPLib instances with satisfactory performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Jingwen"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yining"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Ruize"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Zhiguang"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Song","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jie"}],"citation-key":"liDeepReinforcementLearning2022","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

However, existing methods could not handle well the pairing and precedence relationships in the pickup and delivery problem (PDP), which is a representative variant of VRP. To address this challenging issue, we leverage a novel neural network integrated with a heterogeneous attention mechanism to empower the policy in deep reinforcement learning to automatically select the nodes. In particular, the heterogeneous attention mechanism specifically prescribes attentions for each role of the nodes while taking into account the precedence constraint, i.e., the pickup node must precede the pairing delivery node. Further integrated with a masking scheme, the learnt policy is expected to find higher-quality solutions for solving PDP.

  {"id":"londonmachinelearningmeetupXavierBressonTransformer2021","abstract":"Sponsored by Evolution AI: https://www.evolution.ai/\n\nWednesday 14 July 2021\n\nAbstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is the most popular and most studied combinatorial problem, starting with von Neumann in 1951. It has driven the discovery of several optimization techniques such as cutting planes, branch-and-bound, local search, Lagrangian relaxation, and simulated annealing. The last five years have seen the emergence of promising techniques where (graph) neural networks have been capable to learn new combinatorial algorithms. The main question is whether deep learning can learn better heuristics from data, i.e. replacing human-engineered heuristics? This is appealing because developing algorithms to tackle NP-hard problems may require years of research, and many industry problems are combinatorial by nature. In this project, we propose to adapt the recent successful Transformer architecture originally developed for natural language processing to the combinatorial TSP. Training is done by reinforcement learning, hence without TSP training solutions, and decoding uses beam search. We report improved performances over recent learned heuristics.\n\nBio: Xavier Bresson is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

  {"id":"luoNeuralCombinatorialOptimization2024","abstract":"Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) is a promising learning-based approach for solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems without specialized algorithm design by experts. However, most constructive NCO methods cannot solve problems with large-scale instance sizes, which significantly diminishes their usefulness for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel Light Encoder and Heavy Decoder (LEHD) model with a strong generalization ability to address this critical issue. The LEHD model can learn to dynamically capture the relationships between all available nodes of varying sizes, which is beneficial for model generalization to problems of various scales. Moreover, we develop a data-efficient training scheme and a flexible solution construction mechanism for the proposed LEHD model. By training on small-scale problem instances, the LEHD model can generate nearly optimal solutions for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with up to 1000 nodes, and also generalizes well to solve real-world TSPLib and CVRPLib problems.

With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout.

We study the query complexity required to train RL agents that generalize to multiple environments. Intuitively, tractable generalization is only possible when the environments are similar or close in some sense. To capture this, we introduce Weak Proximity, a natural structural condition that requires the environments to have highly similar transition and reward functions and share a policy providing optimal value. Despite such shared structure, we prove that tractable generalization is impossible in the worst case. This holds even when each individual environment can be efficiently solved to obtain an optimal linear policy, and when the agent possesses a generative model. Our lower bound applies to the more complex task of representation learning for the purpose of efficient generalization to multiple environments. On the positive side, we introduce Strong Proximity, a strengthened condition which we prove is sufficient for efficient generalization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Malik","given":"Dhruv"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuanzhi"},{"family":"Ravikumar","given":"Pradeep"}],"citation-key":"malikWhenGeneralizableReinforcement2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2101.00300","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"number":"arXiv:2101.00300","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"When Is Generalizable Reinforcement Learning Tractable?","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00300"},
  {"id":"markovQuantizedDistributedTraining2023","abstract":"Communication-reduction techniques are a popular way to improve scalability in data-parallel training of deep neural networks (DNNs). The recent emergence of large language models such as GPT has created the need for new approaches to exploit data-parallelism. Among these, fully-sharded data parallel (FSDP) training is highly popular, yet it still encounters scalability bottlenecks. One reason is that applying compression techniques to FSDP is challenging: as the vast majority of the communication involves the model's weights, direct compression alters convergence and leads to accuracy loss. We present QSDP, a variant of FSDP which supports both gradient and weight quantization with theoretical guarantees, is simple to implement and has essentially no overheads. To derive QSDP we prove that a natural modification of SGD achieves convergence even when we only maintain quantized weights, and thus the domain over which we train consists of quantized points and is, therefore, highly non-convex. We validate this approach by training GPT-family models with up to 1.3 billion parameters on a multi-node cluster. Experiments show that QSDP preserves model accuracy, while completely removing the communication bottlenecks of FSDP, providing end-to-end speedups of up to 2.2x.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Markov","given":"Ilia"},{"family":"Vladu","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Alistarh","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"markovQuantizedDistributedTraining2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2302.02390","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,5]]},"number":"arXiv:2302.02390","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Quantized Distributed Training of Large Models with Convergence Guarantees","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02390"},

As real-world graphs are large, training GNNs in distributed systems is desirable.

Meanwhile, a lack of reconciliations of different local models leads to converging up and down across workers. In this work, we design DEPR, a suitable framework for distributed GNN training. We propose a degree-sensitive edge partitioning with influence-balancing and locality-preserving to adapt distributed GNNs training by following an owner-compute rule (each partition performs all the computations involving data that it owns). And then knowledge distillation and contrastive learning are used to reconcile the fusion of local models and boost convergence.

We consider a parameterized stochastic policy, and by applying a policy gradient algorithm to optimize its parameters, the trained model produces the solution as a sequence of consecutive actions in real time, without the need to re-train for every new problem instance. On capacitated VRP, our approach outperforms classical heuristics and Google’s OR-Tools on medium-sized instances in solution quality with comparable computation time (after training).

  {"id":"panDeepReinforcementLearning2023","abstract":"Accurate and real-time tracking for real-world urban logistics has become a popular research topic in the field of intelligent transportation. While the routing of urban logistic service is usually accomplished via complex mathematical and analytical methods. However, the nature and scope of real-world urban logistics are highly dynamic, and the existing optimization technique cannot precisely formulate the dynamic characteristics of the route. To ensure customers’ demands are met, planners need to respond to these changes quickly (sometimes instantaneously). This paper proposes the formulation of a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to solve a dynamic and uncertain vehicle routing problem (DU-VRP), whose objective is to meet the uncertain servicing needs of customers in a dynamic environment. Considering uncertain information about the demands of customers in this problem, the partial observation Markov decision process is designed to frequently observe the changes in customers’ demands in a real-time decision support system that consists of a deep neural network with a dynamic attention mechanism. Besides, a cutting-edge reinforcement learning algorithm is presented to control the value function of the DU-VRP for better training the routing process’s dynamics and uncertainty. Computational experiments are conducted considering different data sources to obtain satisfactory solutions of the DU-VRP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Pan","given":"Weixu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shi Qiang"}],"citation-key":"panDeepReinforcementLearning2023","container-title":"Applied Intelligence","container-title-short":"Appl Intell","DOI":"10.1007/s10489-022-03456-w","ISSN":"1573-7497","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"405-422","source":"Springer Link","title":"Deep reinforcement learning for the dynamic and uncertain vehicle routing problem","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-022-03456-w","volume":"53"},
  {"id":"pashaExactMetaheuristicAlgorithms2022","abstract":"Emergencies, such as pandemics (e.g., COVID-19), warrant urgent production and distribution of goods under disrupted supply chain conditions. An innovative logistics solution to meet the urgent demand during emer­ gencies could be the factory-in-a-box manufacturing concept. The factory-in-a-box manufacturing concept de­ ploys vehicles to transport containers that are used to install production modules (i.e., factories). The vehicles travel to customer locations and perform on-site production. Factory-in-a-box supply chain optimization is associated with a wide array of decisions. This study focuses on selection of vehicles for factory-in-a-box manufacturing and decisions regarding the optimal routes within the supply chain consisting of a depot, sup­ pliers, manufacturers, and customers. Moreover, in order to contrast the options of factory-in-a-box manufacturing with those of conventional manufacturing, the location of the final production is determined for each customer (i.e., factory-in-a-box manufacturing with production at the customer location or conventional manufacturing with production at the manufacturer locations). A novel multi-objective optimization model is presented for the vehicle routing problem with a factory-in-a-box that aims to minimize the total cost associated with traversing the edges of the network and the total cost associated with visiting the nodes of the network. A customized multi-objective hybrid metaheuristic solution algorithm that directly considers problem-specific properties is designed as a solution approach. A case study is performed for a vaccination project involving factory-in-a-box manufacturing along with conventional manufacturing. The case study reveals that the devel­ oped solution method outperforms the ε-constraint method, which is a classical exact optimization method for multi-objective optimization problems, and several well-known metaheuristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasha","given":"Junayed"},{"family":"Nwodu","given":"Arriana L."},{"family":"Fathollahi-Fard","given":"Amir M."},{"family":"Tian","given":"Guangdong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhiwu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Dulebenets","given":"Maxim A."}],"citation-key":"pashaExactMetaheuristicAlgorithms2022","container-title":"Advanced Engineering Informatics","container-title-short":"Advanced Engineering Informatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.aei.2022.101623","ISSN":"14740346","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4]]},"language":"en","page":"101623","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exact and metaheuristic algorithms for the vehicle routing problem with a factory-in-a-box in multi-objective settings","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1474034622000891","volume":"52"},

In this work, we propose a unified branch-cut-and-price (BCP) algorithm to solve ten variants of the problem, considering not only the standard version but also those including additional attributes such as a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, time windows, route duration, multiple depots, and location decisions. The resulting problem that generalizes all of these variants can be formulated as a heterogeneous location routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery and time windows (HLRPSPDTW), for which we propose a compact formulation to serve as the basis for an extended formulation associated with the BCP approach. The proposed exact method includes many of the features developed in recent years, such as a bucket graph-based labeling algorithm, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, and dynamic ng-sets.

However, to enhance the accuracy of the model, we introduce moth flame optimization-attention-LSTM (MFO-Attention-LSTM) as an improvement to the conventional LSTM-attention model. The MFO algorithm is utilized instead of the traditional backward propagation method to calculate attention layer parameters, thereby allowing the model to jump out of local optima. The proposed model outperforms the SVM, CNN, RNN, LSTM, and LSTM-Attention models in terms of the F1 score. Empirical results demonstrate that the optimization of the MFO algorithm contributes significantly to the improved performance of the prediction model.

A fleet of configurable vans is available each day to transport participants to and from the center, as well as to secondary facilities for rehabilitative and medical treatment. The number of participants and support equipment that a van can accommodate depends on how it is configured. An exact method is introduced based on branch and price and cut. At each node in the search tree, the master problem is solved by column generation to find a lower bound. To improve the bound, subset-row inequalities are applied to the variables of the master problem. Columns are generated by solving the pricing subproblems with a labeling algorithm enhanced by new dominance conditions. Local search on the current set of columns is used to quickly find promising additions. Implementation details and ways to improve the performance of the overall procedure are discussed.

  {"id":"renGradePredictionBased2019","abstract":"Over the past decade, low graduation and retention rates have plagued higher education institutions. To help students graduate on time and achieve optimal learning outcomes, many institutions provide advising services supported by educational technologies. Accurate grade prediction is an integral part of these services such as degree planning software, personalized advising systems and early warning systems that can identify students at-risk of dropping from their field of study. In this work, we present next-term grade prediction models based on students' cumulative knowledge and co-taken courses. The proposed models are based on a matrix factorization framework and incorporate a co-taken course interaction function to learn the influence from the co-taken courses on the target course. The co-taken course interaction function is formed by a neural network, which takes the knowledge difference between the co-taken courses and the target course as input, and outputs an influence value that will be used to predict students' grades on the target course. The experimental results on various datasets from a U.S. University demonstrate that the proposed models significantly outperform competitive baselines across different test sets. Furthermore, we analyze the proposed models' performance with different numbers of co-taken courses as well as different numbers of co-taken course subjects, and highlight with an application case study how a student might make decisions related to selection of courses.

Each charging station offers charging service with a known technology of chargers and time dependent charging costs. Charging stations are also subject to operating time windows constraints.

Intermittent charging at the depot is also allowed provided that constraints related to the electricity grid are satisfied. The objective is to minimize the number of employed vehicles and then minimize the total travel and charging costs.

However, the dependency of graph structure increases the difficulty of achieving high-efficiency distributed GNN training, which suffers from the massive communication and workload imbalance. In recent years, many efforts have been made on distributed GNN training, and an array of training algorithms and systems have been proposed. Yet, there is a lack of systematic review on the optimization techniques from graph processing to distributed execution. In this survey, we analyze three major challenges in distributed GNN training that are massive feature communication, the loss of model accuracy and workload imbalance. Then we introduce a new taxonomy for the optimization techniques in distributed GNN training that address the above challenges. The new taxonomy classifies existing techniques into four categories that are GNN data partition, GNN batch generation, GNN execution model, and GNN communication protocol.We carefully discuss the techniques in each category.

We are given a database of sequences, where each sequence is a list of transactions ordered by transaction-time, and each transaction is a set of items. The problem is to discover all sequential patterns with a user-specified minimum support, where the support of a pattern is the number of data-sequences that contain the pattern. An example of a sequential pattern is“5% of customers bought ‘Foundation’ and ‘Ringworld’ in one transaction, followed by ‘Second Foundation’ in a later transaction”. We generalize the problem as follows. First, we add time constraints that specify a minimum and/or maximum time period between adjacent elements in a pattern. Second, we relax the restriction that the items in an element of a sequential pattern must come from the same transaction, instead allowing the items to be present in a set of transactions whose transaction-times are within a user-specified time window. Third, given a user-defined taxonomy (is-a hierarchy) on items, we allow sequential patterns to include items across all levels of the taxonomy.","author":[{"family":"Srikant","given":"Ramakrishnan"},{"family":"Agrawal","given":"Rakesh"}],"citation-key":"srikantMiningSequentialPatterns1996","container-title":"Advances in Database Technology — EDBT '96","DOI":"10.1007/BFb0014140","editor":[{"family":"Apers","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Bouzeghoub","given":"Mokrane"},{"family":"Gardarin","given":"Georges"}],"event-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","ISBN":"978-3-540-49943-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-17","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"Springer Link","title":"Mining sequential patterns: Generalizations and performance improvements","title-short":"Mining sequential patterns","type":"paper-conference"},

This paper broadens the current scope of neural solvers for NPC problems by introducing a new graph-based diffusion framework, namely DIFUSCO. Our framework casts NPC problems as discrete {0, 1}-vector optimization problems and leverages graph-based denoising diffusion models to generate high-quality solutions. We investigate two types of diffusion models with Gaussian and Bernoulli noise, respectively, and devise an effective inference schedule to enhance the solution quality. We evaluate our methods on two well-studied NPC combinatorial optimization problems: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS). Experimental results show that DIFUSCO strongly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art neural solvers, improving the performance gap between ground-truth and neural solvers from 1.76% to 0.46% on TSP-500, from 2.46% to 1.17% on TSP-1000, and from 3.19% to 2.58% on TSP10000.

Consequently, each vehicle should visit not only customer nodes but also (possibly) some charging stations before the battery got depleted. The importance of this problem stems from the fact that logistics companies are increasingly relying on electric vehicles in urban distribution. We propose three exact approaches. The first one requires solving a compact polynomial-sized formulation. The second approach is a branch-and-cut algorithm. An original feature of this algorithm is that it embeds the first exact separation of the well-known rounded capacity constraints. Finally, the third approach is a hybrid algorithm that requires solving an augmented variant of the compact formulation. We report the results of a computational study that was carried out on a set of 125 instances, providing evidence that the polynomial-sized formulation can consistently solve instances having up to 30 customer nodes and 21 charging stations, and that the hybrid algorithm solves some instances having up to 100 customer nodes and 21 charging stations while requiring moderate CPU times. Furthermore, the proposed approach was shown to exhibit limitations in solving some large-scale tightly-constrained instances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Tahami","given":"Hesamoddin"},{"family":"Rabadi","given":"Ghaith"},{"family":"Haouari","given":"Mohamed"}],"citation-key":"tahamiExactApproachesRouting2020","container-title":"Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","container-title-short":"Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,1]]},"page":"102126","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Exact approaches for routing capacitated electric vehicles","type":"article-journal","volume":"144"},

The energy consumption model incorporates several factors such as vehicle dynamics, road information, and charging losses. Then, the problem is reformulated based on the Markov decision process and solved using the transformer-based DRL method. The policy network is designed following the Transformer structure, including an encoder, a feature embedding module, and a decoder, where the feature embedding module is added to provide contextual information. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superior of the proposed DRL method over existing learning-based methods and conventional methods, in solving both EM-EVRP and DM-EVRP.

However, the restrictions on the multiple vehicles’ service sequences and non-linearity caused by the late penalties make it time-consuming to solve this problem. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework inspired by transformer architecture to generate tours instantly after offline training. This framework, as trained through the policy gradient method, consists of the information encoder process which can extract the coupling relationships among the pickup and delivery customers, and the decoder process with multi-vehicle attention network to allocate reasonable orders to each vehicle. Validated on Sioux Falls network, the proposed method yields the improvement of 2.4%-8.0% on the solution quality compared with Google OR-Tools and several heuristic algorithms. Notably, the baselines require dozens of minutes to achieve a lesser result on the case with 100 customers while the well-trained model based on our method can be deployed to provide a high-quality solution within seconds. Furthermore, the proposed model also shows good generalization ability in different scenarios with various scale problems, and the obtained results are shown to be quite robust to counter the fluctuation of travel time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,28]]},"citation-key":"TransformerBasedReinforcementLearning","language":"en-US","title":"Transformer-Based Reinforcement Learning for Pickup and Delivery Problems With Late Penalties","type":"webpage","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9847118"},

Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence and Neural Turing Machines, because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems -- finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem -- using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Vinyals","given":"Oriol"},{"family":"Fortunato","given":"Meire"},{"family":"Jaitly","given":"Navdeep"}],"citation-key":"vinyalsPointerNetworks2017","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1506.03134","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,2]]},"number":"arXiv:1506.03134","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Pointer Networks","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03134"},

  {"id":"voImprovingSubtourElimination2023","abstract":"Branch-and-Cut is a widely-used method for solving integer programming problems exactly. In recent years, researchers have been exploring ways to use Machine Learning to improve the decision-making process of Branch-and-Cut algorithms. While much of this research focuses on selecting nodes, variables, and cuts [11,9,26], less attention has been paid to designing efficient cut generation strategies in Branch-and-Cut algorithms, despite its large impact on the algorithm performance. In this paper, we focus on improving the generation of subtour elimination constraints, a core and compulsory class of cuts in Branch-and-Cut algorithms devoted to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem, which is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization problems. Our approach takes advantage of Machine Learning to address two questions before launching the separation routine to find cuts at a node of the search tree: 1) Do violated subtour elimination constraints exist? 2) If yes, is it worth generating them? We consider the former as a binary classification problem and adopt a Graph Neural Network as a classifier. By formulating subtour elimination constraint generation as a Markov decision problem, the latter can be handled through an agent trained by reinforcement learning. Our method can leverage the underlying graph structure of fractional solutions in the search tree to enhance its decision-making.

  {"id":"wangSolvingCombinatorialOptimization2023","abstract":"Combinatorial optimization, such as vehicle routing and traveling salesman problems for graphs, is NP-hard and has been studied for decades. Many methods have been proposed for its possible solution, including, but not limited to, exact algorithms, approximate algorithms, heuristic algorithms, and solution solvers. However, these methods cannot learn the problem’s internal structure nor generalize to similar or larger-scale problems. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been applied to combinatorial optimization and has achieved convincing results. Nevertheless, the challenge of effective integration and training improvement still exists. In this study, we propose a novel framework (BDRL) that combines BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and deep reinforcement learning to tackle combinatorial optimization over graphs by treating general optimization problems as data points under an identified data distribution. We first improved the transformer encoder of BERT to embed the combinatorial optimization graph effectively. By employing contrastive objectives, we extend BERT-like training to reinforcement learning and acquire self-attention-consistent representations. Next, we used hierarchical reinforcement learning to pre-train our model; that is, to train and fine-tune the model through an iterative process to make it more suitable for a specific combinatorial optimization problem. The results demonstrate our proposed framework’s generalization ability, efficiency, and effectiveness in multiple tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Lai","given":"Kenneth H."},{"family":"Tang","given":"Chunlei"}],"citation-key":"wangSolvingCombinatorialOptimization2023","container-title":"Information Sciences","container-title-short":"Information Sciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.ins.2022.11.073","ISSN":"0020-0255","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"930-946","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Solving combinatorial optimization problems over graphs with BERT-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025522013627","volume":"619"},

A neural network model is constructed as an approximate state solution to the ODE system, such that the neural network model contains the prediction of the LP problem. Furthermore, we extend the capability of the neural network by taking the parameter of LP problems as an input variable so that one neural network can solve multiple LP instances in a one-shot manner.

We propose two parallel algorithms to eﬃciently solve the column-generation based linear-programming relaxation for this VRP. Speciﬁcally, we focus on algorithms for the “pricing problem” which corresponds to the resource-constrained elementary shortest path problem. The ﬁrst algorithm extends the pulse algorithm by Lozano et al. (2015), for which we derive a new bounding scheme on the maximum load of any route. The second algorithm is based on random coloring from parameterized complexity (Alon et al., 1995), which can be also combined with other techniques in the literature for improving VRPs, including cutting planes and column enumeration. We conduct numerical studies using VRP benchmarks (with 50–957 nodes) and instances of a medical home care delivery problem using census data in Wayne County, Michigan. Using parallel computing, both pulse and random coloring can signiﬁcantly improve column generation for solving the linear programming relaxations and we can obtain heuristic integer solutions with small optimality gaps. Combining random coloring with column enumeration, we can obtain improved integer solutions having less than 2% optimality gaps for most VRP benchmark instances, and less than 1% optimality gaps for the medical home care delivery instances, both under a 30-minute computational time limit. The use of cutting planes (e.g., robust cuts) can further reduce optimality gaps on some hard instances, without much increase in the runtime.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Miao"},{"family":"Nagarajan","given":"Viswanath"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Siqian"}],"citation-key":"yuImprovingColumnGeneration2022","container-title":"INFORMS Journal on Computing","container-title-short":"INFORMS Journal on Computing","DOI":"10.1287/ijoc.2021.1105","ISSN":"1091-9856, 1526-5528","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"953-973","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Improving Column Generation for Vehicle Routing Problems via Random Coloring and Parallelization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/ijoc.2021.1105","volume":"34"},

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware.

  {"id":"zhangSequentialPatternMining2023","abstract":"Increasingly, researchers have suggested the benefits of temporal analyses to improve our understanding of the learning process. Sequential pattern mining (SPM), as a pattern recognition technique, has the potential to reveal the temporal aspects of learning and can be a valuable tool in educational data science. However, its potential is not well understood and exploited. This chapter addresses this gap by reviewing work that utilizes sequential pattern mining in educational contexts. We identify that SPM is suitable for mining learning behaviors, analyzing and enriching educational theories, evaluating the efficacy of instructional interventions, generating features for prediction models, and building educational recommender systems. SPM can contribute to these purposes by discovering similarities and differences in learners’ activities and revealing the temporal change in learning behaviors. As a sequential analysis method, SPM can reveal unique insights about learning processes and be powerful for self-regulated learning research. It is more flexible in capturing the relative arrangement of learning events than the other sequential analysis methods. Future research may improve its utility in educational data science by developing tools for counting pattern occurrences as well as identifying and removing unreliable patterns. Future work needs to establish a systematic guideline for data preprocessing, parameter setting, and interpreting sequential patterns.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yingbin"},{"family":"Paquette","given":"Luc"}],"citation-key":"zhangSequentialPatternMining2023","container-title":"Educational Data Science: Essentials, Approaches, and Tendencies: Proactive Education based on Empirical Big Data Evidence","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-99-0026-8_6","editor":[{"family":"Peña-Ayala","given":"Alejandro"}],"event-place":"Singapore","ISBN":"978-981-99-0026-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"219-254","publisher":"Springer Nature","publisher-place":"Singapore","source":"Springer Link","title":"Sequential Pattern Mining in Educational Data: The Application Context, Potential, Strengths, and Limitations","title-short":"Sequential Pattern Mining in Educational Data","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-0026-8_6"},
  {"id":"zhaoSurveyLargeLanguage2023","abstract":"Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wayne Xin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Junyi"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Tianyi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaolei"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Yupeng"},{"family":"Min","given":"Yingqian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Beichen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Zican"},{"family":"Du","given":"Yifan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yushuo"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhipeng"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Jinhao"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Ruiyang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yifan"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Xinyu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zikang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Peiyu"},{"family":"Nie","given":"Jian-Yun"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Ji-Rong"}],"citation-key":"zhaoSurveyLargeLanguage2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2303.18223","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,31]]},"number":"arXiv:2303.18223","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Survey of Large Language Models","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223"},

  {"id":"zhouInstanceConditionedAdaptationLargescale2024","abstract":"The neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) approach has shown great potential for solving routing problems without the requirement of expert knowledge. However, existing constructive NCO methods cannot directly solve large-scale instances, which significantly limits their application prospects. To address these crucial shortcomings, this work proposes a novel Instance-Conditioned Adaptation Model (ICAM) for better large-scale generalization of neural combinatorial optimization. In particular, we design a powerful yet lightweight instance-conditioned adaptation module for the NCO model to generate better solutions for instances across different scales. In addition, we develop an efficient three-stage reinforcement learning-based training scheme that enables the model to learn cross-scale features without any labeled optimal solution. Experimental results show that our proposed method is capable of obtaining excellent results with a very fast inference time in solving Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRPs) across different scales. To the best of our knowledge, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance among all RL-based constructive methods for TSP and CVRP with up to 1,000 nodes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Changliang"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Xi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhenkun"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Xialiang"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Mingxuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qingfu"}],"citation-key":"zhouInstanceConditionedAdaptationLargescale2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2405.01906","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,3]]},"number":"arXiv:2405.01906","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Instance-Conditioned Adaptation for Large-scale Generalization of Neural Combinatorial Optimization","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01906"},
