# Reinforcement Learning for Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem

# Motivation
1. Address the complexity of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) by developing a reinforcement learning framework that can produce near-optimal solutions efficiently.

------

# Research question and objective
1. Develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning model to solve various VRP instances without the need for retraining on each new problem.
2. Optimize routing decisions by learning a policy that generalizes across problem instances.

--------
# Strengths
1. The model can handle a wide range of VRP instances from a given distribution without retraining.
2. Produces high-quality solutions with comparable computation times to classical heuristics after initial training.
3. Capable of handling different VRP variants, such as capacitated VRP and split deliveries.

# Weaknesses
1. Requires significant computational resources and time for initial training.
2. May face challenges when scaling to very large problem instances or different distributions.
