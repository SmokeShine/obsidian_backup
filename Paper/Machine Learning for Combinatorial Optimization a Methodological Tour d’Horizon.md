# Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization a Methodological Tour dâ€™Horizon

# Motivation
1. Integrate machine learning (ML) techniques with combinatorial optimization (CO) to improve decision-making processes and reduce reliance on handcrafted heuristics.

------

# Research question and objective
1. Explore how ML can be leveraged to solve combinatorial optimization problems by learning effective policies and approximations.
2. Investigate the relevant distribution of problems to use for learning on a given task.

--------
# Strengths
1. ML can approximate solutions for NP-hard problems, offering practical alternatives to exhaustive search.
2. Enables the discovery of new policies through experience, potentially outperforming traditional methods.
3. Can be applied to a wide range of CO problems, adapting to different constraints and requirements.

# Weaknesses
1. ML models may struggle with scalability and generalization to unseen problem instances.
2. Solutions provided by ML may lack optimality guarantees compared to traditional methods.
