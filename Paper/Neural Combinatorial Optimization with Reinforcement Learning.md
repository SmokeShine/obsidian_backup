# Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Reinforcement Learning

# Motivation
1. Develop a framework that leverages neural networks and reinforcement learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems efficiently, without the need for handcrafted heuristics.

------

# Research question and objective
1. Design a model that can learn effective strategies for solving combinatorial problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), through reinforcement learning.
2. Optimize the model to generalize across various problem instances and sizes.

--------
# Strengths
1. Eliminates the need for problem-specific heuristics by learning directly from data.
2. Capable of adapting to different types of combinatorial problems with minimal modifications.
3. Potential to scale to larger problem instances due to the use of neural networks.

# Weaknesses
1. Requires significant computational resources and time for training.
2. May struggle to generalize to problem instances significantly different from those seen during training.
