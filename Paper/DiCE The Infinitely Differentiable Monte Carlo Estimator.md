# DiCE The Infinitely Differentiable Monte Carlo Estimator

# Motivation
1. Allow newton raphson method by allowing second order derivative 
2. Allow infinite differentiable
	1. For second order derivative, we cannot directly use log trick as the reward is also dependent on action taken. 
	2. So, it proposes a function form which can remove parts (parts which causes dependency when expanding the expectation equation and putting f(x) probability)and requires changing the formula
		1. It is a wishlist operator and hence called MagicBox
		2. Finding such as operator may be difficult
			1. Can it even be applied for TSP?
			2. Looks it is used when we want to apply
