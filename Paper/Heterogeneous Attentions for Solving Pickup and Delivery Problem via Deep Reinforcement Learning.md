# Heterogeneous Attentions for Solving Pickup and Delivery Problem via Deep Reinforcement Learning

# Motivation
1. Address the complexity of the Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP) by leveraging heterogeneous attention mechanisms to improve solution quality and efficiency.

------

# Research question and objective
1. 1. Develop a deep reinforcement learning model using heterogeneous attentions to solve the PDP, considering the unique constraints and requirements of pickup and delivery tasks.

--------
# Strengths
1. Demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods by effectively handling complex constraints in PDP.
2. Capable of scaling to larger problem instances due to the efficient use of attention mechanisms.
3. Adapts to various problem settings and constraints, offering versatile solutions.

# Weaknesses
1. The model's architecture and training process can be complex, requiring careful tuning and implementation.
2. May require significant computational resources for training and inference.
