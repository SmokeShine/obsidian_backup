# Learning combinatorial optimization algorithms over graphs

# Motivation
1. Leverage machine learning to develop efficient algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems over graph structures, which are prevalent in real-world applications like network design and logistics.

------

# Research question and objective
1. Investigate how graph-based neural networks can learn to solve combinatorial optimization problems more efficiently than traditional methods.
2. Develop models that can generalize across different graph types and sizes.

--------
# Strengths
1. Utilizes the natural structure of graphs, allowing for more intuitive modeling of relationships and constraints.
2. Capable of generalizing learned strategies to unseen graph instances, reducing the need for problem-specific heuristics.
3. Potential to handle large-scale graph problems due to efficient learning mechanisms.

# Weaknesses
1. Designing and training graph-based neural networks can be complex, requiring significant expertise and computational resources.
2. Performance heavily relies on the quality and diversity of training data, which may limit generalization.
