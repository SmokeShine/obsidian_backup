# Integrating Machine Learning Into Vehicle Routing Problem Methods and Applications

# Motivation
1. Enhance the efficiency and adaptability of vehicle routing solutions by integrating machine learning techniques with traditional optimization methods.

------

# Research question and objective
1. Investigate how machine learning can be combined with existing heuristics and metaheuristics to improve the performance and scalability of vehicle routing solutions.
2. Develop models that can adapt to dynamic changes in routing constraints and environments.

--------
# Strengths
1. Machine learning can improve the quality and speed of solutions by learning from data and adapting to new problem instances.
2. ML models can quickly adjust to changes in constraints, such as delivery windows and vehicle capacities.
3. The integration of ML allows for handling larger and more complex VRP instances efficiently.

# Weaknesses
1. The integration of ML with traditional methods can increase the complexity of the solution process.
2. The performance of ML models heavily relies on the availability and quality of training data.
