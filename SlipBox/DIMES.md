# DIMES
1. DIfferentiable Meta Solver
2. Can be used Combinatorial Optimisation Problems
3. Can use REINFORCE algorithm as parameterisation space is continuous

## Advantages of DIMES

1. Can fine tune as massive sampling is possible with parallelization
2. Initialising good model parameters by sampling which may be beneficial for fine tuning
