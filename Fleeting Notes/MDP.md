# MDP

1. Markov Decision Process
2. Follows [[Markov Reward Process]] + ability to take actions
3. MDP can be discrete, continuous or [[Bandit, One Step MDP]], while action can be discrete or continuous
5. if we keep on sampling from [[State Transition Matrix]] and follow one after the another from this matrix, we get draws for the MDP
6. MDP is defined by ([[State]],[[State Transition Matrix]])
