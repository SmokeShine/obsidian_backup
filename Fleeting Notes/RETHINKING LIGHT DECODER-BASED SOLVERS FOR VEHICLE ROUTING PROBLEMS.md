# RETHINKING LIGHT DECODER-BASED SOLVERS FOR VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEMS

# Motivation
1. Encoder has think of all possible scenarios that decoder can encounter
	1. Encoder is not aware of out of distribution context, so decoder has to do with 
	2. New pattern may emerge at scale

------

# Research question and objective
1. Decoder is not conditioned properly
2. Decoder is struggling because it has to remove context. In NLP, context adds as repetition is possible. In VRP, context decreases as we manually mask. So, the KV cache is not used properly
