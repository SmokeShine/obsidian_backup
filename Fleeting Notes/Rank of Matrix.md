# Rank of Matrix

- dimension of [[Vector Subspace]]
	- all basis of [[columns space]] will have the same number of vectors to definite the vector subspace
	- And as A is matrix, rank of A will be number of independent equations
		- same linear algebra logic of number of equations = number of unknowns
	- if all equations are independents, then all vectors in column space are independent, the matrix can be inverted
		- Full Rank matrix
