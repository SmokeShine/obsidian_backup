# Rollout Baseline

- if used a [[Rollout Policy]] n times and received different rewards, we take the average, and compare against individual run, so it is a measure of variance
- in [[Advantage Function]], we compare the reward for taking the action against the default reward (V(s)). So, it is a little different.
