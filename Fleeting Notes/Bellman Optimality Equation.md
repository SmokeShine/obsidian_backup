# Bellman Optimality Equation

optimal value function - agent can take the action with the max Q-value on that state instead of taking expectation.

optimal state-value function - As we can't control where the environment pushes us after taking the action, there is no max here, but we need to take expectation of being in all possible state

Used for getting the optimal state value function and policy.
