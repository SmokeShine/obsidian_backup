# Linear Dependence

- if there are more vectors than number of dimensions, then all these vectors are linearly dependent
	- more columns than rows in a matrix
		- more equations than variables
- The smallest number of vectors is called [[Basis for Subspace]]
	- if the matrix is invertible, it is a basis
		- invertible means square matrix
		- linear independence else invert won't exist
	- As there are infinite solutions, we can have multiple basis vectors with same number of dimensions/vectors in it
	- This becomes the dimension of [[Vector Subspace]]
