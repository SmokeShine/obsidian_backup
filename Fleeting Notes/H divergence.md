- used in [[Domain Adversarial Neural Network]]
- a plane where all hypothesis or classifier exists
- We want a sample where both classifiers gives similar performance
	- classifier can't distinguish if it is from source domain or target domain
	- both side
- Find the [[Suprenum]]
	- a classifier from target domain which is closest to all set of classifiers from source domains which have similar performance
