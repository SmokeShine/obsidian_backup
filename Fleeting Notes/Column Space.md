# Column Space

- [[Vector Subspace]] with special properties that generates a matrix
- so, column space is all vectors possible to achieve by multiplying a matrix, which is a linear transformation of vector
	- so, linear transformation of vector should exist somewhere and we combine all this space and call it column space
	- so, Ax=b has a solution only if b is in column space of A
- So, for infinite solution, we can show them by combining [[Null Space]] vector and Column Space vector
