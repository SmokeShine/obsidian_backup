# Gaussian Elimination

-  Matrix can be seen as coefficients which when multiplied with vectors give the equations
- As number of equations = number of unknowns, we can solve them manually
- if we can convert the matrix into upper triangle, then the last row is assignment and we can manually calculate the rest of variable values by plugging values one at a time
- If keep right hand side and left hand side separated by a |, we can solve it quickly
- This is called gaussian elimination and we can create an algorithm around it
