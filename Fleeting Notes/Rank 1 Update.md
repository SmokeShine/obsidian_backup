1. $5*1$ * $1*5$  will give $5*5$ matrix. This is same as two big matrix multiplication to get the size. So, the two big matrix can be seen as multiplication of two vectors + sum= dot product, and do it for each combination of row and column to sum it up
	1. 1st column and 1st row
		1. . $5*1$ * $1*5$
