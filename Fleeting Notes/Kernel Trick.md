# Kernel Trick

Think of infinite sin and cos series expansion. Even though they contain infinite elements, we can still calculate the sum in finite time using properties. This sum of infinite features in finite time through special projections with properties is referred as kernel trick

One example is [[Random Basis Function (RBF)]]

Using kernels, we can apply very good [[Prior]] for function space, not weight.
