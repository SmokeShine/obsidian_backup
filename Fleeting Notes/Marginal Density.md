# Marginal Density

i assume that x1 varies with x2. So, it can be seen as coordinate. So, area under the curve can be calculated by taking a slice of base and multiplying with height. and then do this for all values of base. this ties of CDF on how much we integrate the base

as x1 changes x2 as well, the integration will become 3D
