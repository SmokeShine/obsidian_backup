# Markovian Property

1. state1 = f(history from x...y...z) 
2. state2= f(history from y...z), 

even if we drop history in state2 by ignoring data from x..y, we are not losing any information to determine what happens next

Probability of next state only depends on the previous state. Even if you take all the history, probability of next state will remain the same
