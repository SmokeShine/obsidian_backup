# Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)

- Unlike Frequentist ML, where we can split in test/train dataset, [[Probabilistic Machine Learning]] use MLE to get the best estimates on prior and does not use test/train split. When we have some idea about the prior, we can use [[Kernel Trick]] to combine multiple kernels to fit the data.
