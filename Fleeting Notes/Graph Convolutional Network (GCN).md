# Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)

1. Message - embedding from neighbours * weight / number of neighbourgs 
2. Aggregation - summation of messages, then activation
3. GNN is a type of neural network
4. GCN is a type of GNN
5. skip connections between hops
	1. not multiplying with any weight
	2. if multiplying weight, then it is seen as a different way for aggregating messages (information from node v itself could get lost)
