# Rank 1 Approximation

- if we have input data, we can try to approximate the data with [[Rank 1 Update]]  by outer product of two vectors
	- how to get this two vectors - check the maths
- Rank 2 approximation can be seen as adding two rank 1 approximation
	- As we add columns, reconstruction will improve
		- so, now this is similar to [[Principal Component Analysis]]
- instead of rank 1, if we have two matrices, then we don't save space but that is similar to [[Collaboration Filtering]]
