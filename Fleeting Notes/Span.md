# Span

- Take two vectors
	- Do weighted sum
	- weights could be anything
	- the final vector which are possible with the weighted sum are called span of "set of vectors"
		- that is the definition of [[Column Space]] of Matrix
			- because multiplying a vector with matrix gives another vector
- because a [[Vector Subspace]] can have infinite vectors
	- so we need to find a finite set with which we can generate the entire subspace by combining them
