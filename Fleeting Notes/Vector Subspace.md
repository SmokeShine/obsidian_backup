# Vector Subspace

- Must satisfy three properties
	- passed through origin
		- vector 0,0,0 is present in the super set
	- adding two vectors remains in the super set
	- multiplying vectors remains in the super set
- if we have a line, we can get all vectors that are on the line to identify if the line is a vector subspace or not
