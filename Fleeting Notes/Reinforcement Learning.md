# Reinforcement Learning

[[Agent]] sees an observation, takes an action and receives a [[Reward]] 
1. Goal is maximisation of expected rewards collected in an episode (Reward Hypothesis)
2. Agent(learns a [[Policy]] through algorithm trained on [[Experience]]) uses [[State]] to decide the next action 
3. If agent can fully observe all the states in the environment, then we can use environment state as agent state. This type of RL is formulated as [[MDP]]
4. If agent can observe the environment partially, then agent state is different from environment state. This type of RL is formulated as [[POMDP]]
