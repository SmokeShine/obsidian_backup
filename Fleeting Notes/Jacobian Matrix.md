# Jacobian Matrix

- Matrix of all partial derivative when we do change of variables

v = Ax

So, the Jacobian J, will be derivative of v with each element of xs

Jacobian is also derivative, and the matrix says the scale by changing one unit vector. So, the matrix itself is Jacobian than multiplies with x
