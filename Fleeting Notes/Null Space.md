# Null Space

- When we have infinite solution for Ax = b, we can write $Ax_s+Ax_n=b$
	- if we can find $Ax_n=0$, then we have a way to write general equation for all possible solutions
	- So, we define a general solution with $x_s$ and $x_n$
		- Specific solution
		- General solution such that if we scale x_n, we get a new vector which is also a solution and can be put in the main equation to get all possible solutions
