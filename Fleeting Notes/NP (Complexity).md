NP stands for non deterministic polynomial time for classifying decision problems
NP can be solved in polynomial time and can be verified in polynomial time.
NP complete can be verified in polynomial time but cannot be solved in polynomial time
NP Hard cannot be verified in polynomial time and cannot be solved in polynomial time
